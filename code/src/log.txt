Event detection in a fully distributed wireless sensor network - WSN

network configuration overview: 
Network have 2 nodes in X dimension and 3 nodes in Y dimension
The size of random number is 1 bits, which indicate event number is bound by range [0, 2]
average encryption time : 0.000009 seconds
average decryption time : 0.000017 seconds
number of message pass between base station and nodes : 14
number of message passing happened among nodes: 280
total events detected: 8

details of nodes involved in communication:
Iteration 1

event number 1 detected on rank (local) 1
adjacent nodes are : 4 0 2 

Iteration 6

event number 0 detected on rank (local) 4
adjacent nodes are : 1 3 5 

Iteration 8

event number 0 detected on rank (local) 1
adjacent nodes are : 4 0 2 

Iteration 11
