Event detection in a fully distributed wireless sensor network - WSN

network configuration overview: 
Simulation will run 200 iterations with 1 milliseconds time interval between each pair of consecutive iteration
Network have 2 nodes in X dimension and 3 nodes in Y dimension
The size of random number is 2 bits, which indicate event number is bound by range [0, 4)
