Event detection in a fully distributed wireless sensor network - WSN

network configuration overview: 
Simulation will run 20 iterations with 10 milliseconds time interval between each pair of consecutive iteration
Network have 2 nodes in X dimension and 3 nodes in Y dimension
The size of random number is 1 bits, which indicate event number is bound by range [0, 2)
